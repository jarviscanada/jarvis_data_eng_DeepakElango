# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: Electrical Engineering had taught me that even the most complicated problems could be solved by one consistently educating yourself
  and by two breaking it down into smaller pieces. As a Junior Data Engineer at Jarvis, I was able to participate in various challenging projects using an
  Agile/Scrum framework that allowed me to become proficient in technologies like Java, Git, SQL, Bash, Maven, and Docker. My interest in the Software Engineering
  field stemmed from a basic heart-beat alarm clock that I made for my mom's birthday, something about the process of solving a complex problem by writing a few lines of code
  on the computer made me fall in love with the field. Over the next few years, I would go on to teach myself data structures, algorithms,
  and programming through various personal projects.
